# The Garage App

The Garage App is a Ruby on Rails application which supports user auth. When logging 
in or signing up, users can add vehicles to their virtual garage. The main goal 
of this app is to simpily store and keep track of a maintenance log for the users 
vehicles.

This app is a work in progress and will continue to have more features added to it, 
along with improvments to the users experience.
